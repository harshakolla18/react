              I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student.
              Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I
              like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting
              individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to
              study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. The
              atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. I like
              to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very
              enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
